# Firedevs Management System
## Description

This project is a simple management system with Students and Groups using NodeJS + Nedb.

# Installation

Open the terminal at the top of the project and do:

```bash
$ yarn
$ node index.js
```

That will install all the dependencies and run the backend. To compile the frontend, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/isaacvr/firedevs-front/blob/main/README.md). Once the front is compiled, copy the `dist` folder at the top of this project's folder. That way the server can load and serve those files.
